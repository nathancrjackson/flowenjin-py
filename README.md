# TaskEnjin
A scheduling engine written in python for running task trees defined as JSON. Suitable for running basic tests on a schedule and then making different web or system calls based on the results.

## Todo
- Implement syscall function
- Implement more robust variable manipulation functions
- Implement global (cross-thread) variables
- Implement logic to cull empty threads instead of running them
- Reconsider thread architecture
